Reinforcement learning agent for learning to play to a modified version of blackjack
the code is structured in two main classes

- Agent:
  different learning algorithms are available (Monte carlo, Sarsa(lambda), Sarsa(lambda) + Linear Approx)

- Environment:
  provides feedback to user's actions, by providing a state representation and a reward signal

In order to test the system and see some relevant metrics concerning its performance
you can run the file "testing.py"
