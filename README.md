# Easy 21

Reinforcement learning agent for learning to play to a modified version of blackjack.

## Algorithms

* Monte carlo, 
* Sarsa(lambda),
* Sarsa(lambda) + Linear Approx

## How to run the agent

In order to test the system and see some relevant metrics concerning its performance
you can run the file "testing.py"

## Structure

the code is structured in two main classes

- Agent:
  different learning algorithms are available

- Environment:
  provides feedback to user's actions, by providing a state representation and a reward signal
